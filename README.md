# Wall-Clock
•Project Title: Wall Clock - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

**•Project Overview:-**

Greetings, fellow developers! Today, I'm excited to share a fun little project I've been working on – a wall clock implemented entirely using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project combines my passion for web development with my fascination for timekeeping, resulting in a visually appealing and functional digital wall clock.

**•Key Features:-**

**(i)Real-Time Updates:** The wall clock displays the current time accurately, with separate hands for hours, minutes, and seconds. It continuously updates in real-time, providing an engaging and dynamic experience.

**(ii)Custom Styling:** I've put effort into making the clock visually appealing. The clock face has been designed with CSS to mimic a classic wall clock, and the hands move smoothly to indicate the time.


**•Technologies Used:-**

**(i)HTML:** The structure of the clock is built using HTML, defining the clock face and hands.

**(ii)CSS:** CSS is utilized for styling and creating the clock face, giving it a classic, elegant look. It also ensures smooth animation of the clock hands.

**(iii)JavaScript:** JavaScript powers the functionality of the clock. It retrieves the current time, calculates the angles for the clock hands, and updates them in real-time.

**•Why I Built This:-**

Creating this wall clock was not only a fun coding exercise but also an opportunity to improve my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. It allowed me to explore real-time updates in web applications and practice responsive design principles.

**•Demo:-**

You can see a live demo of the digital clock **[here](http://127.0.0.1:5500/clock.html)**. Feel free to interact with it and see how it updates in real-time.

**•Contributions:-**

I encourage contributions from the open-source community. If you have any suggestions, improvements, or bug fixes, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Let's make this wall clock even better together!

**•Acknowledgments:-**

I'd like to thank the online coding community for their support and inspiration. This project wouldn't have been possible without the knowledge and resources available from various online tutorials and forums.
